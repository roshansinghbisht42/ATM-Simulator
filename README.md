# ATM Simulator in Java

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is a simple **ATM (Automated Teller Machine) simulator** built in Java.  
It demonstrates core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as:
- **Encapsulation** (private fields, public getters/setters)
- **Abstraction** (separating account logic from ATM operations)

The program allows a user to:
- Withdraw money  
- Deposit money  
- Transfer money between accounts  
- Check account balance  
- Authenticate using account number and PIN
